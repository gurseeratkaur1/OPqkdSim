# Interactive Simulation of QKD Protocols: Analysis of QBER and SKR Performance Metrics

## Abstract:
In recent years, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) has seen a rapid advancement to widespread practical applications, drawing considerable attention from both academic and commercial sectors. Simultaneously, there has also been a growing interest in the performance and efficiency of various QKD protocols. In this paper, we put forward a simulation-based study of several QKD protocols, such as BB84,BBM92, Decoy State, Coherent One Way (COW), and Differential Phase Shift (DPS) protocols. We simulate the Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) and Secret Key Rate (SKR) under varying parameters to provide a deeper understanding of their performance and inner workings. In addition to the simulation results, we introduce a web-based graphical user interface (GUI), allowing users to interactively explore protocol behaviour and visualise the impact of various parameters on QBER and SKR. This tutorial aims to introduce an intuitive understanding of various QKD protocols to both researchers and students alike, through accessible simulation and visual analysis tools.
