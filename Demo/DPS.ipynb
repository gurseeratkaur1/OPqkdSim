    "## Conclusion: Differential Phase Shift (DPS) QKD Simulator\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Differential Phase Shift (DPS) QKD Simulator** presented in this module provides an accessible yet rigorous framework for exploring the performance and security of DPS-based quantum key distribution systems. By encapsulating both the fundamental physics and the practical engineering parametersâsuch as mean photon number, detector efficiency, channel loss, and dark countsâthe simulator enables users to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Visualize and analyze** how the secret key rate (SKR) and quantum bit error rate (QBER) depend on both the mean photon number and the transmission distance.\n",
    "- **Apply security proofs** (GLLP and original DPS-specific formulas) to obtain realistic bounds on key rates.\n",
    "- **Optimize protocol parameters** (e.g., mean photon number) for maximal secure throughput.\n",
    "- **Demonstrate trade-offs** inherent in real-world QKD deployments, such as the impact of increasing channel loss or detector imperfections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through interactive plotting and parameter adjustments, users can gain intuition about the operational regime of DPS-QKD, making this simulator a useful tool for both education and protocol research.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "While the current simulator offers a comprehensive platform for DPS-QKD analysis, several avenues remain open for enhancement and further research:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Integration of Advanced Attack Models:**  \n",
    "   Extend the simulator to include explicit modeling of eavesdropping strategies (e.g., photon number splitting attacks, optimal quantum cloning), and simulate countermeasures such as decoy states.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Finite-Key Effects:**  \n",
    "   Incorporate finite-key analysis, accounting for statistical fluctuations in realistic, finite-length key exchanges, which are critical for practical deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Experimental Imperfections:**  \n",
    "   Model additional sources of system imperfections, such as polarization drift, time jitter, and afterpulsing in detectors, for even more realistic performance predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Multi-User and Networked Scenarios:**  \n",
    "   Expand the simulation to address multi-user QKD networks, key relay, and trusted repeater architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Comparison with Other Protocols:**  \n",
    "   Build out unified interfaces and visualizations to directly compare DPS-QKD performance with BB84, COW, and other QKD protocols under identical conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **User Interface Improvements:**  \n",
    "   Develop a graphical or web-based front end to make the simulator accessible to users without programming experience and facilitate classroom demonstrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Integration with Experimental Data:**  \n",
    "   Enable importing experimental or field trial data to benchmark and validate simulation results.\n"
